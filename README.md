# Exploring-Security-Measures-for-Molecular-Communication

Error Correction, Detection and Distance estimation

This project explores the theoretical aspects of molecular communication, focusing on the analysis of channel capacity, secrecy capacity, and mutual information in communication channels. The project implements various algorithms, including the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm, to optimize input distributions and evaluate the performance of communication channels under different environmental conditions, distances, and release rates. The code also includes error detection and correction mechanism like Hamming code.
Hamming Encoding:
        The function hamming_encode(message) encodes a 4-bit message using a generator matrix (G) to produce a 7-bit codeword. This codeword includes parity bits that help in detecting and correcting errors.

    Hamming Decoding:
        The function hamming_decode(received_codeword) decodes a received 7-bit codeword. It calculates the syndrome using a parity check matrix (H) to detect errors. If an error is detected, the function identifies the erroneous bit and corrects it before extracting the original 4-bit message.

These functions are classic error correction methods. The code demonstrates how to encode a message, simulate transmission errors, and then decode the message, correcting any single-bit errors introduced during transmission.

Introduction

Molecular communication is an emerging field where chemical signals are used to transmit information between biological and synthetic systems. This project simulates the communication process between two entities (e.g., Alice and Bob) while considering the presence of an eavesdropper (Eve). The project evaluates key metrics like channel capacity and secrecy capacity, which are crucial for secure communication in noisy environments.
Features

    Calculation of channel capacity using the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm.
    Secrecy capacity and mutual information analysis.
    Error detection and correction using Hamming codes.
    Visualization of the impact of varying distances, release rates, and environmental conditions on channel performance.
    Simulation of secure communication in the presence of an eavesdropper.

Requirements

    Python 3.x
    NumPy
    Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using pip:

pip install numpy matplotlib
Usage

    Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/molecular-communication-project.git
cd molecular-communication-project
Run the script:
  python molecular_communication_project.py
    View the results:
        The script prints the calculated channel capacities, secrecy capacities, and mutual information to the console.
        Plots showing the impact of distance, release rate, and environmental conditions on the channel capacities are also generated.

Customization

You can modify the parameters in the script to simulate different scenarios:

    channel_matrix: Define the transition probabilities for the communication channels.
    release_rate, distance, environmental_conditions: Adjust these to see their effects on the channel capacity and secrecy capacity.

Results

The project generates insights into the behavior of molecular communication channels under various conditions. Some of the key outputs include:

    Channel Capacity: Maximum reliable transmission rate between Alice and Bob.
    Secrecy Capacity: Difference between the channel capacities of the legitimate channel (Alice to Bob) and the eavesdropped channel (Alice to Eve).
    Mutual Information: Quantifies the amount of information successfully transmitted.

The project also visualizes the relationship between these metrics and varying parameters like distance, release rate, and environmental conditions.
